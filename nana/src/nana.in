# nana - generates a set of gdb(1) commands from the inputs source files.
#
# Arguments: a list of C/C++ source code plus the usual C flags. Note
#   that all the -D, -I options passed to nana(1) must be the same as
#   those passed to the orginal compile.
#
# Strangeness: since this command gets passed compile options (e.g. -lm)
#    we need to strip these out before passing to CPP lest we get errors.
#    For now I've just copped out and redirected stderr to /dev/null
