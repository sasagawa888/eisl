# Policy 

I want to keep Easy-ISLisp as small and simple as possible.

I was a fan of Scheme. It was around R3RS ~ R5RS. I fell in love with Scheme's simple and elegant design philosophy. 
However, after R6RS, Scheme changed its policy to become huge.
I hated the recent huge Scheme.

Around that time, I learned about the ISLisp standard. It is very simple and compact. I fell in love with this.
For this reason I want to keep Easy-IS Lisp as small and simple as possible.

## C Coding
It is written within the scope of C17 and does not depend on anything beyond the standard library. This minimizes maintenance costs well into the future.

We use
[GNU Indent](https://www.gnu.org/software/indent/)
to format the code.
In particular, KR style with the -kr option.
Just try to fit in with the existing code for naming conventions.
